This is an example of a PHP script being used to paste inthe content of another file into the main one ^.^It's a highly useful technique to organise the websiteinto managable parts, and may be used to localise certainelements - for example, when one wishes to edit theheader, it would be a crime for one to have to edit the header in<em>every</em> web page that happens to have one!Just be careful: by default PHP does not work when opening thefile locally with your browser, so to see the effects you need toupload it to the server first!<br>As you may (not) see, there is no trace of PHP from the user's pointof view, aside from the file name. That's because PHP is a server sidelanguage, unlike JavaScript, and is thus secure from being seen by theuser. So don't put any secret code outside of PHP!<br>So good luck everyone!
